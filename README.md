# Dotfiles
----------

These are my dotfiles for Arch Linux with Hyprland. For me are ok but I want to make it better

I will update it


Programs:
 - Hyprland
 - Pamixer
 - Kitty
 - Waybar 
 - Zsh
 - nwg-look
 - sddm
 - blueman-manager
 - ... and dependecies


Some of the scritps are taken from JaKooLit dotfiles. These scripts are modified but 

Other files are the default 

Also credits to Oh-My-Zsh
