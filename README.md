# Dotfiles
----------

These are my dotfiles for Termux on Android. Cloned from my dotfiles of Arch Linux with Hyprland. For me are ok but I want to make it better

I will update it


Programs:
 - Zsh
 - Neovim
 - Fastfetch
 - ... and other things that I don't remenber
 - ... and dependecies


Some of the scritps are taken from JaKooLit dotfiles. These scripts are modified but 

Other files are the default 

Also credits to Oh-My-Zsh
